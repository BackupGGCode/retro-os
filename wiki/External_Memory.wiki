This is a tutorial on how to make a external memory device for RETRO OS.
I used an Arduino and an EEPROM.


= Tutorial =

== 1.) Have it read from the serial port constantly ==

Pseudo Code:
{{{
while(true)
{
    int ReadSer = Read_Serial();
}
}}}

== 2.) Check for Init ==
Pseudo Code:
{{{
int Init = 0x00;
int AddrSize = 8; //The Size of the addr word
int WordLength = 8; //The length of a Word

if(ReadSer == Init)
{
    Write_Ser(Addrs);
    Write_Ser(WordLength);
}
}}}

== 3.) Check for Read/Write ==
Pseudo Code:
{{{
int Read = 0x01;
int Write = 0x02;

if(ReadSer == Read)
{
    Write_Ser(0x00); //Allow RETRO to know that the device is responding
    byte addr = Read_Ser();
    Write_Ser(ReadMem(addr))//ReadMem is the function to read from the memory device you are using
}

if(ReadSer == Write)
{
    Write_Ser(0x00); //Allow RETRO to know that the device is responding
    byte addr = Read_Ser();
    Write_Ser(0x00); //Allow RETRO to know that the device is responding
    int data = Read_Ser()
    Write_Ser(0x00); //Allow RETRO to know that the device is responding

    WriteMem(addr,data);//WriteMem is the function to Write to the memory device you are using
}
}}}

Thats It! (So For, More to come!!)
