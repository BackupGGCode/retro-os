Retro OS documentation

Current release: 1.0.0

1.) We will not give out the source code for RETRO. We have some "parts" of it on our website if anyone needs help making their own OS in C/ASM.

2.) Retro is still in the Alpha stage, so it may crash or glitch up every once in a while. It "may" be fixed in the first stable version.

3.)The Documentation:

none yet!

4.)Credits:

  * Peter: Programming, implementing graphics, some ideas
  * Lars: Graphics, ideas
  * Nick: Graphics, ideas
  * Dayton: Programming, Ideas
  * Basil: Ideas

"That's all Folks!"
